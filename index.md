# Learn It To Earn It

### Introduction

For most people, things in this life aren't given they're earned.
You need to be able to learn and adapt to new situations in todays world.
This blog hopes to help you learn things along the way.
I encourage everyone to take a stab at some of the things practiced in here before reading.
The best way to learn is to fail and you'll never forget the lesson.
In creating this blog I've failed many many times, so join me on this journey of massive failure.

### Background

My name is Phillip Werner. I'm a Software Engineering manager who has 8 years of experience.
I currently work for an Ed-Tech company and am looking to start my own company.
In this blog I'm trying to create an area for people to go and get good ideas on how to start up things quickly and inexpensively.
We'll start with the basics (getting a static website up and running) and move on to the harder things (creating applications/aws infrastructure).
My goal is to build a company that can help others with onboarding of other engineers and even contractual work.
Let's start learning and growing together!
